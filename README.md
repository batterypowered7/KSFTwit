#**KSFTwit**

KSFTwit is a simple, text-based Twitter client meant to be run from the terminal. It uses the Twitter4J library for the Twitter API. Though not terribly thorough, KSFTwit does provide the user with some basic functions, such as:

- Publishing a new tweet.
- Sending a direct message to a user.
- Reading direct messages that have been received.
- Displaying the twenty most recent tweets on your feed.


##Where to Download:

[Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html)

[KSFTwit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v2tu52j34gompm9/TwitterTerminal.jar)

##Instructions:

1. Download KSFTwit. The file will be named TwitterTerminal.jar
2. Save the file to a directory that is easy to navigate to.
   For this example, we'll be using the desktop.
3. Open the Terminal/Command prompt and navigate to the desktop
   by typing 'cd desktop', without the single quotes.
4. Run the program using the command 'java -jar TwitterTerminal.jar'
   again without the single quotes.
5. The application will present you with a URL where you will obtain
   a pin number so that it may access your account. The URL will
   automatically copy to your clipboard.
6. Enter the pin you obtain from the URL into the terminal window.
   This will grant you access to the application's functions.
