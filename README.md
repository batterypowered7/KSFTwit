#**KSFTwit**

KSFTwit is a simple, text-based Twitter client meant to be run from the terminal. Though not terribly thorough, KSFTwit does provide the user with some basic functions, such as:

- Publishing a new tweet.

- Sending a direct message to a user.

- Reading direct messages that have been received.

- Displaying the twenty most recent tweets on your feed.


##Where to download:

[KSFTwit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v2tu52j34gompm9/TwitterTerminal.jar)

##Instructions:

1- Download KSFTwit. The file will be named TwitterTerminal.jar
2- Save the file to a directory that is easy to navigate to.
   For this example, we'll be using the desktop.
3- Open the Terminal/Command prompt and navigate to the desktop
   by typing 'cd desktop', without the single quotes.
4- Run the program using the command 'java -jar TwitterTerminal.jar'
   again without the single quotes.
5- The application will present you with a URL where you will obtain
   a pin number so that it may access your account. The URL will
   automatically copy to your clipboard.
6- Enter the pin you obtain from the URL into the terminal window.
   This will grant you access to the application's functions.
